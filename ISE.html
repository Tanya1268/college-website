            DEPARTMENT OF ISE:
            <br>
            The Department of Information Science & Engineering (ISE), was established in the year 1999 . To accommodate the needs of the software industry, the Department was founded with an initial intake of 40 students. Further, the intake was increased to 60 in the year 2000 and subsequently to 120, 180 and 240 in the year 2016,2019 and 2024 respectively. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles, theories, and practical applications that form the foundation of Information Science, a dynamic field at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and engineering. This course helps the students to delve into the diverse and evolving landscape of information systems, data management, and computational intelligence. Information Science Engineering plays a pivotal role in our increasingly digitized and interconnected world, influencing the way we communicate, process information, and make decisions.
